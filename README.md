### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Zheda(Marco) Mai, and I am a second-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University, advised by Professor [Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao](https://sites.google.com/view/wei-lun-harry-chao). My research interests lie in continual learning, transfer learning and learning with limited & imperfect data.  

I obtained my MASc. from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) advised by [Prof. Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/). I mostly worked on Continual Learning and Recommender Systems during my master collaborating with [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/).

Prior to that, I  completed my BASc. in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Erkang Zhu](http://ekzhu.com/).

You can find more information about me at my personal page: https://zheda-mai.github.io/.

You can contact me at mai.145@osu.edu or by [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-zheda-mai-574a0b85/).
